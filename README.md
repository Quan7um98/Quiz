# Rune-Quiz

## Description

I wanted to make a quiz that could help people learn about ancient nordic runes.

## Usage
The user has to guess what each rune represents in a timed quiz, and if they get it right, they move on to the next quesstion. If they get the answer wrong then they lose time. The quiz ends either when time runs out or once all questions are answered.

## Future Development Plans
- Implement more questions (currently there are only 4)
- Implement Images of each rune and not just its name for better understanding
- Allow the user to imput their initials and record their score.
